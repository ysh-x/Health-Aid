# Health-Aid

Health Aid The proposal is a smart diagnostic tool that can diagnose/identify the possible
health conditions the person may have or is likely to possess in the near
future.
A framework/database is built with all the common health conditions and the
possible symptoms.
The software gets input from the user such as height, weight, gender, age,
lifestyle, food intake, and much more.


Based on the inputs and the symptoms that userâ€™s experience. The application
analyses the user data with the help of the built framework and provides the
insights under four different categories as mentioned below
1. The health conditions
2. The possible cause
3. Suggestions
4. Cure
They would be tested under common conditions like obesity and much more and
would warn them against the possible health conditions that they are likely to
receive in the upcoming years.
